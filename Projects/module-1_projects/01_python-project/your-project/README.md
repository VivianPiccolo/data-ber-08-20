## Project Description
I chose to build a Hangman game as it's is a classic word game played worldwide. As I am a passionate traveller, the secret words of this game are names of different countries. 

## Rules
- Only one player can play per round. 
- The player will receive the number of letters that the word consists of.
- Each turn the player can insert one letter.
- The player has to guess the word in ten attempts. 
- The secret word will always be a name of a country consisting only of lowercase a-z characters.
- The game ends when either the player makes ten wrong guesses or the player completes the word.
- When the secret word is completed by the player, before the ten attempts are reached, the player wins the game.
- Have fun!

## Workflow
I decided the theme of my game and then I wrote down all the variables that I would need to build the game. After it was done, I started coding the game using functions to shape it. I ran Jupyter Notebook several times in order to find errors and handle them. After all was completed I wrote simple but friendly messages to be printed to the player. The final step was to succesfully test the game.

## Organization
I used jupyter notebook for writing the code. My repository consists of two files: Game_Hangman.ipynb and README.md
