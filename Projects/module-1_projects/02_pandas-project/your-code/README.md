#Project02 - Data Wrangling

Vivian Piccolo - DATAFT- Berlin- August 2020

## Overview

The goal of this project was to combine everything I have learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas.

1 - Import a messy data set: "GSAF5"
2 - Clean it 
3 - Export it as a cleaned CSV data file

##Workflow

* Import the file with pandas
* Examine the data and understand what the fields mean
* make a copy of the data frame
* Check the head of the data, number of columns and rows 
* Check the size, length and detect missing values
* After evaluating data, drop unuseful columns
* Eliminate duplicates
* Replace irrelevant data
* Export cleaned data as a csv file

##Organization

I used jupyter notebook for writing the code. 
My repository consists of four files: 

1 - GSAF5.csv 
3 - GSAF5_cleaned.csv 
4 - data-wrangling.ipynb
5 - README.md
